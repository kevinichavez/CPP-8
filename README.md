# CPP-8-Emulator
A Simple CHIP-8 Interpretter written in C++

"CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers."
- Wikipedia

This is a work-in-progress implementation of a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It is not fully compatible with all ROMs, and there is currently no sound.
